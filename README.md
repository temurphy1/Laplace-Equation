# Laplace-Equation
Application of the Laplace Equation to graph the temperature distribution of a circular plate in steady state heat transfer


For a circle with radius a, the general solution to the Laplace Equation is:
$$
u(r, \theta) = A_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty r^n \left( A_n \cos(n\theta) + B_n \sin(n\theta) \right)
$$
