# Laplace-Equation
Application of the Laplace Equation to graph the temperature distribution of a circular plate in steady state heat transfer


For a circle with radius a, the general solution to the Laplace Equation is:
u(r,theta) = A<sub>0</sub> + $$  f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}*r^n*A<sub>n</sub>  $$
